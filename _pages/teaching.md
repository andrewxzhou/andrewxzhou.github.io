This page contains my personal thoughts on cmu courses I've taken, as well as a bit of overall personal reflection. For a more objective look at courses (as well as opinions from a lot of other people), check out [kailey's course review page](https://kaileyhh.github.io/course-reviews/).

Other inspirations for this include:
- [abigale kim's course reviews](https://abigalekim.github.io/courses/)

### Summer 2024
- 18-213 **[Introduction to Computer Systems](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/18213-m24/www/)**, Gregory Kesden

  From a very rough sampling of people I know, I would say at most 25% \(possibly less\) of SCS freshmen manage to find an internship. For the rest of SCS, doing research or taking courses tends to be the main option. And personally, I think taking a course like 18-213 is an excellent choice. 

  As a 200-level CS core, 213 is generally regarded as relatively difficult. However, much of this difficulty does not come from conceptual difficulty like in 251. Instead, 213 is difficult because of the sheer amount of time required, particularly for the programming projects in the latter half of the course \(cache, malloc, shell, and proxy\). Nothing involved in writing these labs is particularly conceptually difficult, but you do need extensive amounts of time on them to understand and in particular to debug them. However, over the summer this is significantly easier because you can pour all of your time into 213.

  Because of this lack of conceptual depth, I feel like 213 just never felt transformative in the way that 251 or 150 felt at times. In 251 or 150, there's usually a beautiful "aha!" moment when you find the solution to the problem, which usually involves some major conceptual leap. This never really happens in 213 - you just pore over the documentation and debug again and again until it works. And when you ask yourself why it works, the only real answer is "idk, I guess it just decided to work now". 

  To put things another way, I felt like I consistently understood how and why my 150 code worked, and even in 122 I felt like I understood how and why my code worked at least 80% of the time. In 213 there were numerous times, particularly in shell and proxy, where I went "okay I'm not even completely sure what I was doing wrong or what I changed, but I guess it works now so whatever". 

  I dunno, I just think this feels quite fake. I certainly think 213 is a very important course, and it's definitely increased my confidence as a programmer. I just also think that it's not a particularly inspiring course. At the end of the day, 213 is a very real world course, and the real world kinda sucks.


### Spring 2024
- 15-251 **Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science**, Anil Ada, Feras Saad
- 15-150 **[Principles of Functional Programming](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/)**, Michael Erdmann, Dilsun Kaynar
- 21-266 **Vector Calculus for Computer Scientists**, Clive Newstead
- 79-262 **Modern China: From the Birth of Mao to Now**
This semester can be divided into roughly two halves: before I dropped 21-266, and after.
